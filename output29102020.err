WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/bruno/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/init_ops.py:1251: calling VarianceScaling.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops) with dtype is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Call initializer instance with the dtype argument instead of passing it to the constructor
WARNING:tensorflow:Large dropout rate: 0.85 (>0.5). In TensorFlow 2.x, dropout() uses dropout rate instead of keep_prob. Please ensure that this is intended.
